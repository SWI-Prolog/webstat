# SWI-Prolog webstat TODO list

  - Add a refresh button to all tabs, possibly also an automatic refresh
  - Add program push events to the interface, so we can (for example)
    add a vertical line in the resource chart at a specific point.
  - Vizualize the SWI-Prolog profiler output similar to kcachegrind
